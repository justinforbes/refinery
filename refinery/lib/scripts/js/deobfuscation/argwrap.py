"""
The obfuscator converts statement sequences into calls to a self-disabling no-op function whose
arguments carry all side effects. This transformer detects the pattern structurally, expands the
calls that reach such a function back into individual statements, and removes the declaration where
the expansion left nothing that reads it.

Which calls reach it is a question about the binding the wrapper declares and never about the name
it answers to, and every part of that question is settled before anything is rewritten:
`_the_calls_that_reach` holds the rule.

    Every call that reaches the wrapper *declaration* declares, or `None` where the expansion is not
    equivalent for *binding*, the binding it declares, at all.

    Expanding a call to the statements its arguments carry is equivalent only where the name holds
    this wrapper when the call runs and nothing observes that the call then disabled it. That is
    three questions about the binding:

    - it is declared once, here, but for a bare `var` of the same name, which stores nothing;
    - every write to it is the self-disabling assignment inside this declaration, so nothing else
      ever puts a value into the name;
    - every reference to it is the callee of a call, so that no read of the name can tell the
      wrapper from what it left behind. The parentheses around a callee and around the call itself
      are looked through, which is what `refinery.lib.scripts.js.analysis.model.enclosing_operator`
      and `refinery.lib.scripts.js.model.strip_parens` are for;
      `refinery.lib.scripts.js.analysis.model.is_invocation_target` answers a wider question than
      this one, counting the tag of a tagged template, which no expansion here is written for. An
      export list naming the wrapper is such a reference — the local half of a sourceless list
      reads the binding — and is never the callee of a call, so an exported wrapper is refused
      here without being looked for separately.

    A reference that is not an identifier stands in for an access made through an object aliasing
    the binding, which is not a name this pass can follow.

    `refinery.lib.scripts.js.analysis.effects.EffectModel.function_escapes` asks a question the
    same shape as this one and answers `True` for every self-disabling wrapper there is: it refuses
    a written binding, a dynamic reference and a second declaration outright, and those three are
    exactly what the carve-outs above are about. It cannot stand in for this.

    A reference a `with` body resolves at run time is counted as a call that reaches the wrapper,
    which the object supplying the name instead would make wrong. That acceptance, and the reason
    it is made rather than refused, is
    `test.lib.scripts.js.test_unfixed_defects.TestAWithObjectMayCarryTheNameAWrapperAnswersTo`; the
