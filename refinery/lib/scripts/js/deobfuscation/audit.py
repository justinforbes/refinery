"""
Attribute a change of strict mode to the pass that made it.

Which bodies of a program run in strict mode is not something any transform is meant to decide, and
the ways one can decide it by accident are all indirect: a fold writes a string where a directive is
read, a hoist puts a declaration above one, a sweep drops one, a promotion carries a body out of the
region that governed it. Each is a defect of a different pass, and what they have in common is only
visible from outside — the mode of some body is not what it was.

`StrictModeAudit` is that outside view. It reads the mode of every body around every transformer
invocation and reports the bodies that survived the pass and came out running in the other mode.
Surviving is what makes the report an answer rather than a distribution: a pass that removes a strict
function, or inlines one into its call site, changes how many strict bodies a program has and changes
nothing about any body that is still there.
