"""
The backward live-variable worklist, over one control-flow graph and a caller's gen/kill oracle.

A value is *live* at a point when some path from there may read it before overwriting it. The solver
is the standard backward fixpoint and knows nothing about what it is tracking: the domain is whatever
hashable thing the oracle returns, which for a language with a binding model is a binding and for one
without could be a name. What a language contributes is the two sets per node — what this node reads,
and what it definitely overwrites — and nothing else.

**The transfer function is deliberately not the textbook one.** A node's live-in is

    use ∪ (normal_out − kill) ∪ exceptional_out

where the textbook rule subtracts `kill` from the whole of live-out. The difference is the
exceptional successors: a statement that may throw part-way through has not necessarily performed
its store, so along that edge the store must not mask an earlier one. Subtracting the kill from the
exceptional set too reports a store as dead whose value the handler can still read, which is a
deletion of live code — and the asymmetry is why this rule is stated here once rather than
rediscovered per language.
