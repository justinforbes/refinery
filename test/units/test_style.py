    No pass installs a value-preserving replacement that takes a redirection out of the tree.

    The suite the source ratchets watch never puts a redirection anywhere, so watching it directly

    the tree primitives counted zero. The corpus is therefore built rather than found: every source
    the suite hands to the parser is reissued once per line with a file redirection appended to that
    line, which puts one in front of every rewrite the suite exercises. It grows as the suite does,
    which is the floor a check that only watches has not got.

    Edits made through `refinery.lib.scripts.ps1.deobfuscation.removal.Ps1RemovalPlan` are not
    substitutions and are exempt. A removal claims the code does not run — resolving a constant `if`
    deletes the branch that was never taken, redirections and all — and that claim is the plan's to
    check. `refinery.lib.scripts.ps1.deobfuscation.substitution.substitute_statement` opens a plan
    of its own, so the exemption is lifted around it, or the very shape this was written for would
    hide inside the owner meant to enforce it.

    **A redirection is counted lost when the pass has finished and it is still gone**, not at the
    moment it leaves a slot. `Ps1ExpandableStringHoist` takes a subexpression out of a string and
    puts it back one statement later, and telling that apart from a loss by reading the `moved`
    argument the pass declares would be taking the pass's word for the very thing this checks. The
    verdict is deferred to the end of the pass rather than to the end of the run, so a later
    removal cannot be charged to an earlier substitution.
