"""
What a long chain of operators costs the folding pass. A chain whose leftmost operand is an unknown
variable folds to itself, so every operator in it is visited and none of them is rewritten: the pass
asks about the same left subtree once per link, and how often the answer has to be *derived* is
therefore what separates a cost that grows with the chain from one that grows with its square.
`refinery.lib.scripts.ps1.analysis.values._evaluated` is the derivation, counted here rather than
timed so that the measurement is the same on every machine.
