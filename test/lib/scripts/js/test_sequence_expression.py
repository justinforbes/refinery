"""
What the printer spells for a comma expression, and what the text it spells reads back as.

A sequence is flat in the source text and nested in the tree, so the commas alone do not say which
tree wrote them: `(a, b), c` and `a, (b, c)` are two trees that both spell `a, b, c` once the
brackets are gone, and reading that back gives one sequence of three. The two compute the same
value, which is why no assertion about what a program prints when it runs could tell them apart,
and why every assertion here is about the text or about the tree that parses out of it.

The trees are reached by parsing a bracketed spelling and then taking the bracket nodes away, which
is the tree a pass holds after folding an expression into the slot a bracket used to occupy. A tree
straight from the parser still carries the brackets its source was written with and would say
nothing about whether the printer can put them back.
