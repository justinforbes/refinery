"""
The head of a `for` loop is not an ordinary expression position, and what the tool prints there has
to be a program that still means what the source did.

A head comes in three shapes — `for (INIT; TEST; UPDATE)`, `for (TARGET in OBJECT)` and
`for (TARGET of ITERABLE)` — and each slot claims a word or an operator for itself. The init slot
reads a bare `in` as the start of a for-in and refuses it, all the way down through a conditional's
alternate, an arrow's expression body and a comma; the for-of iterable slot is a single
`AssignmentExpression` and refuses a comma; the for-of target slot refuses anything opening with the
word `let`, where the for-in target only refuses `let` immediately before a bracket. The three
refusals are not each other's and none of them is the one an ordinary statement makes: a statement
refuses a leading `{` and a leading `function`, which every one of these slots accepts.

The brackets that get a refused expression into a slot are therefore load-bearing text, and they are
not necessarily nodes: a pass that folds an expression into the slot a bracket used to occupy leaves
a tree that has to be printed with brackets nothing in it holds. So the law here is not that the
brackets come back, it is that the output is a program that does what the input did, and it is
checked over three ways of getting from a source to an output — printing what was parsed, printing
after every bracket in the tree is replaced by what it holds, and printing what the deobfuscation
passes leave behind.

Node.js decides all of it. Every head is recorded together with what V8 prints for it and with a
second spelling of the same head, one bracket added or taken away, and what V8 prints for that one:
where the two differ the bracket carries meaning, and where they agree the slot tolerates it either
way. Both spellings are re-measured by the tests, so a row cannot go stale into a claim nothing
checks.

`HEADS` is the whole corpus and the law below is quantified over all of it. Seven of these rows were
a second table the law had to leave out, each one a head whose `in` the parser read under a ban the
grammar had already lifted; they are ordinary rows now.

SECURITY: the snippets here are hand-authored and benign, and running them is what makes the engine
the oracle. Nothing from `samples` may ever be fed to this.
