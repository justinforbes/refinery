"""
The name an import or export list gives the far side of the module boundary, and what a tool writes
for a specifier half it could not read.

That position holds a word or a string literal, and the two are separate productions rather than
two spellings of one thing. A string names the text it denotes: `export { x as 'a b' }` reaches a
name no word spells, an escape between the quotes stands for the character it names, and the quotes
themselves are how the text was written and no part of it — which is what a module asking for the
name `"'a b'"` is refused for.

The other half of a specifier names a binding the file creates, and a text no name is read from
leaves the position holding the span that was written. The span is what comes back out: a
declaration printed without the `as` clause it was written with is a different declaration and not
a repair, whatever the parser made of the half it could not read.

Every answer here is Node's over a graph of `.mjs` files, since a module is the only kind of code
these declarations appear in and what one of them reaches is the linker's answer rather than the
parser's.

The hazard this module is written against is its own: a unicode escape typed into a Python string is
resolved by Python and reaches JavaScript as the character it names, so every escape here is
assembled from `chr(92)` and every table is checked for the backslash it must carry.

SECURITY: every module below is written out by this file and Node runs only those. Nothing from
`samples` may ever be handed to the engine.
