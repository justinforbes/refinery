"""
An array literal holds one element for every position its commas spell, and a position that was
left empty is a hole rather than a value. `[1, , 2]` is three long and so is `[1, 2, ,]`, while
`[1, 2, ]` is two: the last comma there separates nothing that follows it. How many commas an array
is written with is therefore the whole of how long it is, which makes it the whole of what the
printer has to write back — a hole at the end is spelled by the comma that would have followed it,
and dropping that comma hands back an array one shorter than the one that was read.

The same commas between the brackets of a destructuring pattern decide how many values are pulled
out of the iterator on the right, so every shape below is written twice: once as a literal filled
with number literals, and once as a pattern filled with names, on the left of an assignment and of
a declaration.

Node.js decides how long each array is. Every recorded length is re-measured by the tests from the
shape as it was written and from the shape as the printer writes it, so no row can go stale into a
claim nothing checks.

SECURITY: the only text handed to the engine is an array literal of number literals, hand-authored
here. Nothing from `samples` may ever be fed to this.
